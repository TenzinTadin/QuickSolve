<< DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT >>

QuickSolve allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Equipped with a clean interface, it also supports advanced mathematical functions like exponentiation and logarithmic operations, making it suitable for a wide range of computational needs.

Its has error handling functionality for accepting only numerical inputs and performs the necessary operations only when they are defined ( eg for the log function, both values of the input must not only be numeric but also both positive)

QuickSolve is an advance version of mathematic calculator.
